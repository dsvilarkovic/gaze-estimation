# gaze-estimation
Rice University research internship where I was part of the FLASH project between Rice University Computer Vision Lab and Baylor College of Medicine. I created multimodal architecture (CNN + simple landmark NN), for gaze-estimation classification (gaze, not gaze), based on various inputs from face (eye region pics for CNN and face landmarks for Simple NN). Pytorch was used as a DL framework and other relevant DS libraries were also used such as Numpy, Pandas etc.
